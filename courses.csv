                              been embraced by scholars, painters, poets, and political thinkers. A religion derived
                              from classical philosophy, folk practices, Buddhism, and Yogic techniques, it perseveres
                              in village rituals, global popular culture, and dissident sects like China's Falungong.

                              their plays and solved problems that present themselves to the playwright. We will
                              discuss these plays each week.  Each week, students will also write scenes in response
                              to writing prompts and share them with the class. We will then respond as a group
                              to the writer with constructive feedback. Through this practice, inspired by the plays
